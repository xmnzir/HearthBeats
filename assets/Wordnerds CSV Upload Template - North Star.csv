01/04/2024,TSM Survey,I am dissatisfied because I've had a hole in my roof in my kitchen since October of last year and the rain comes through into my kitchen. I had a surveyor come out and he said he couldn't get anyone out until after Christmas because they're not allowed to put up scaffolding over Christmas. I said that was fair enough and that I would wait. It's now nearing May and they haven't fixed it. I've phoned three or four times and the surveyor said to me he had totally forgotten and he would get it done. I've got nothing out of them. When I moved in I had asbestos tiles that were coming up and my son is an asbestos stripper. He told me to get those tiles up because they were asbestos. I phoned North Star Housing and they sent someone to take them up but they haven't replaced them with anything. I've got a black floor all the way down the hallway. I've complained about the window in the hallway because they were supposed to paint it. I've got panelling outside that has been off for three months. Nothing has been done. I want to move.

01/10/2024,TSM Survey,"Being a wheelchair user and having to wait seven to eight months for repairs to get done is really unacceptable. Them having occupational therapy and making sure their property is wheelchair accessible I think is also really insulting. Like I said, this property was designed for a wheelchair user so the doors are extra wide and they had to provide a ramp as I couldn't get the wheelchair in through the door. North Stars reaction to me voicing my concerns through an advocate when having meetings with North Star is very concerning. I recently had a phone call about one of the health and safety risk assessments that they're coming out this Friday to do, and my advocate was present during this phone call and they were trying to get me to do the paperwork over the phone which would cut out my advocate. It seems like they're not happy that I have an advocate. In my personal opinion, they tried to cut out my advocate which I'm pretty sure is illegal. North Star used to be really good but then Covid hit and it seems like they don't care about the tenants anymore, nor their safety or wellbeing. All they want is the rent and that is it. Last year I was really struggling with my physical and mental health and so my property hasn't been to a reasonable standard which I'm aware of and trying to sort it but instead of sitting down with me and saying they will get me more help, they have instead threatened me with an eviction and I'm a wheelchair user.

06/03/2025,Stage 1 Complaint,"I first reported an issue with the bathroom January 2024. We then had someone come look at the bathroom March 2024 and set out a plan of what needs to be done. 
It’s been a whole year since we have not been able to use our bathroom due to the work being done.
I call every few weeks and I am told the same thing. That someone would be out to do the final jobs as soon as possible. Someone then comes and does a little task, like the time a guy came just to hang up the shower curtain… really ?? I didn’t know you needed a professional to hang a shower curtain. They then leave saying someone else will be back to do the rest. They don’t come and I have to call again a week or two later practically begging for someone to get the job done. The operator I speak to every time seems to raise this with “Bash” and the companies that do the job and she gets back to me ensuring they will get it done but it’s the same cycle a week or two later. 

We are still waiting for: 
1) The Shower: it is half installed, the front comes off and it does not turn on (see attached image)
2) Sink: leaks. There’s water hitting the back wall under the sink (please see attached image. The hot water faucet also moves. 
3) Radiator: There is no radiator 
4) Window: window in the shower is missing a panel at the top (see attached image). 
5) Toilet: is not stable once again! (See attached video) 

There might be more tasks that need to be carried out but we don’t know. 

This really is getting out of hands. We’re paying for a house with two bathrooms but we have not been able to use one for a year. ",ALBE0101600,Reason for complaint,General Needs,Middlesbrough,49,Asian or Asian British: Other,House,No disability

18/02/2025,Stage 1 Complaint,"I would like to make a formal complaint about the repair of my oil heating i.e. sonic watchman part. This was first reported on Thursday 26th September 2024. 
   A first visit was made to my home on Monday 30th September 24, where i explained the watchman was not showing the correct level of oil. It was showing level 7 which i knew was not correct. I have had the oil heating for approximately 6 years and I normally order oil twice yearly, around April & September months. Therefore, i knew that the watchman was not working and i was due to order my oil. 
   Further visits were made on 28th October & 25th November 24 where the oil was checked with a stick and stated that i had enough oil in the tank. The watchman was still showing level 7 again. Bearing in mind, the last time i ordered my oil was the 5th May 2024 and the fact the watchman level had not moved in over 2 months, this was ignored. I would like it to be noted, that I generally have my oil on for 11 hours a day. 
   After 3 visits it was stated that another visit would be booked in to check the oil. This left me very anxious and worried about whether, i would have enough heating for the Christmas period. Finally on the 7th January 25 the oil was checked again and confirmed that the watchman needed replacing. I then, had to chase up the repair again, taking another 3 weeks. The part was fitted on the 30th January 25 which turned out to be a five minute job. The new watchman then showed the oil was at level 3. When the oil was first installed, i was informed that i should order oil at level 4. As a result of the failure to order the watchman sooner,  my radiators failed to heat up and i was then left with no heat or hot water for 4 days until the oil arrived on the 4th February 25. This would never have happened, if the part was ordered at first instance. 
  Due to health problems, it is vital, that i have my heating on daily for long periods of time. The repair took 4 months, 5 visits and repeated refusals",FALL0101600,Reason for complaint,General Needs,Cockfield,76,White: English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British,House,Disability

07/02/2025,Stage 1 Complaint,"My tenants are having various damp and condensation issues throughout their top floor flat. 
Issues are below:

Lounge- Mould spots on lounge ceiling - IW attended around Christmas and advised tenants there is nothing they can do, they've been in the loft and the tiles and insulation look okay in this particular area, despite the mould spots getting worse. 

Bedroom - mould spots across ceiling.. following the initial visit around Christmas time, IW returned for a second visit and put some insulation in the loft space above the bedroom. This is now worse than before.

Bathroom - The fan in the bathroom leaks rain water in, tenant has been told that the pipe to the fan on the roof is not sealed. They've also said that the tiles on the building are the incorrect tile, because of the pitch/angle of the roof the tiles should be pan tiles and they aren't. 

The tenants are deeply unhappy as the appointment to address the issues with the water ingress in the bathroom has been moved and rearranged three times now. 

Secondly - The lounge and bedroom remain in a worse state than before IW attended. 

The tenants have said that there is no communication between the various Repair guys that attend and the tenants now have no idea what the new rearranged visit is for on the 17th Feb, I.e are they looking at the fan or the roof as both trades are conflicting with one another's info when visiting.

This is also causing distress due to the multiple visits, and tenant's hospital appointments.

I myself rang IW to ask that the appointment which was rearranged for 17th Feb after the tenant waited in all day to be notified late afternoon that they would not be coming due to running over on a previous job, and was told that if a cancellation becomes available they will contact the tenants otherwise the apt will be between 8 and 1pm on the 17th Feb..

13/12/2024,Stage 1 Complaint,"Tenants not happy (furious actually) about how Marsdens left property today after damp work? States they didn’t cover surfaces up so carpet rolled up on stairs covered in debris, place a mess, dust everywhere,  the boiler/radiators now don’t work (0800 are calling today though as they have been assured), the internal door (one just after main front door) and lounge door been taken off and not put back on.  States they are freezing and sick of waiting for boiler to be sorted.  They said water everywhere but after speaking to Bash he said that’s been sorted (tenants refute this)
 
They really  don’t want them (Marsdens)  in their house again for any future work. Also say lads been rude.
 
To be fair the tenants according to Marsdens weren’t polite/cooperative with them throughout which tenants deny. They do both have mental/physical health problems so this wont help with the situation.
 
I stated they should place the internal door against the area its meant to be resituated temporary to keep heat in if safe to do so and have visitors go back way to visit but she refused stating they don’t have alleygate key. They also refused me dropping off electric heaters temporary.   Ive text her again for reference in case anything else occurs overnight and they need to chase 0800 tonight or something else happens.

06/12/2024,Stage 1 Complaint,U0454158 was raised to Ian Williams on 16 June for a roofing contractor to undertake a roof inspection as the property has solar panels and pigeons and other birds were accessing underneath them. Hartburn roofing attended in July to measure up for netting to be installed to restrict access for the birds. Tenant has been chasing North Star for repair completion dates ever since. On 25th September IW advised he hadn't recieved a quote for the works from Hartburn Roofing and would chase up. The quote was sent to North Star on 4th November. The quote was not placed into the 'quote log' until 15th November. Tenant called in again on 6th December to advise no contact had been made from Hartburn Roofing. This again was chased  who advised the quote remains unactioned therefore the delay continues. Tenant is exasperated with the slow response hence her request for a formal request raising. Tenant has dementia and a recent SCS Survey identified that due to the lack of action the birds have now dislodged roof tiles - this is causing further disctress to tenant as now she is anxious that water/snow will ingress affecting her home interior. The SCS surveyor also stressed that scaffold should not be required due to the property being a bungalow and believes a tower scaffold would be adequate. Tenant has been very patient and tolerable during this extended wait however feels 6 months for roof net installation is uncalled for.,BART0200400,Reason for complaint,General Needs,Hartlepool,77,White: English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British,Bungalow,No disability

24/09/2024,Stage 1 Complaint,"I would like to make complaint regarding your housing officer . In July I had a telephone conversation with her regarding how some months the full rent payment would be paid on 21st and other months part will be paid on the 21st and the rest on the 6th. I explained that this was due to how I receive my wages on 21st and universal credit on 6th. Some months I get more wages and less UC and other months it’s the opposite way round . I agreed to pay £600 in total covering the rent and part arrears . Which I have done , last month I paid the full amount on the 21st but this month I text to state that £200 had been paid today (Saturday) and then the other £400 on 6th but then the full £600 would be on 21st .october. She text me back advising that she would be sending me a notice to intend to seek possession. I have not mis sed the payments since I had the conversation with her on the telephone call in July explaining the fact that I may need to split the payments. It’s down right disgusting that your housing office thinks it’s appropriate to firstly do this when I have made her aware of the split and have made the payment since we had this discussion but that she thought it’s appropriate to do this via text . Your previous officer come to my door , I’m not sure if your staff are poorly trained or just this your bullying tactics to scare customers . I’m a time when there is a cost of living crissis you should be training your staff to be more considerate . Surely if this was needed then there is better processes in place than texting someone when I was having the decency to make her aware of how I was paying this month.

Since we have moved into the property approx 5 years ago there has always been issues with leaking in the bathroom running down to the utility room. Numerous jobs have been raised for people to come out to fix various things.
Earlier this year the leaking got really bad and everything anyone showered a constant steam of water would run down the wall in the utility room.
Surveyor came out and as we have had so many issues in past with the bathroom he requested a job for the bath to be pulled out and the flooring underneath replaced, new shower, pull off all old tiles to check shower pipes behind then retile. 
Eventually after some delays this work was completed by Ian Williams.
After all the work the leak was not fixed!!
Since then we have scraped together enough money to do the work ourselves, properly.
I have attached photos of the flooring AFTER your contractor completed their work.
I will also forward receipts from screwfix and b&q which shows all the things we have had to buy to correct the work done by your contractors.
This is only brief but if someone would like to contact me I'm more than happy to go through everything in more detail.

I have contacted north star on numerous occasations regarding repair work to be carried out following a leak last year in the master bedroom and the bathroom repairs to stop the leak were carried out but the cosmetic damage that it has done to the inside of the house has not been completed. i dont want to have to take this matter further as i think that the bathroom wall has damp in it and is causing my son to have a cough whenever he is at my house. i will have no choice if this is not done in a timely manner as my sons health is more important. this is the final email i will send regarding these repairs.

0800 has found that it looks like the engineer has adv T he would be there Wed but that this has not been communicated back to office as it’s the office that has to book this in. I offered T Friday and he has reluctantly taken it and has advised me all the following below, but when I said Id ben making a service request which is what we used to call informal complaint he has said no he wanted to go formal.


T said its not good enough this has been going on for 2months he has had this problem, every single day he has had different issue
He is having to have the heating on just so they can get hot water so its costing them extra money to use hot water

Outcome of complaint – don’t want this to happen to anyone else, they are not doing the job right, and they are lying to us, giving reasons for not attending such as someone is off ill etc.
Would like an acknowledgement sent out in post

13/03/2024,Stage 1 Complaint,"I am writing to yourselves with sheer despair and total frustration. 
Over 3 years ago Joanne reported a return of damp issues within proeprty. Agents visited but nothing happened! Approximately 5 months ago this issue was raised again with yourselves as large areas of the walls were blistering again and laminate floor lifting due to damp ingress. 
Over the following months 0800 repair have visited the property in excess of 10 times, with many reports and photos being taken! But nothing has yet been sorted!
Today 12 th March both Ian Williams and 0800 repair where supposed to be visiting to finalise the leak! 
Ian Williams arrived but after waiting an hour, we contacted yourselves only to be informed 0800 know nothing about the meeting and will not be attending.
Secondly the engineer from Ian Williams was a carpenter because he had been informed we had wooden floors! So after all the visits and photos no one noticed we had concrete floors!
An engineer has visited to look at removing the adapted bath but have heard nothing for 3 weeks?
4 weeks ago we were told someone would contact us reference the roof mounted transport rail and it's removal again no one has contacted us! 
It was suggested that the small shower and sink be removed from the wet room because it is no longer needed. As it will save you having to replace the expensive wet room floor! But again this has vanished and no one seems to know anything about it!
Currently the water leak is costing excessive costs as the meter is running constantly 24 hours a day. This has been the case for 3 years!
This whole situation is ridiculous and totally unacceptable, the rent is always paid on time and is 100% up to date.
Yet Northstar seems to be incapable of sorting the issue, no one wants too progress the issue to other parties to solve the problem but if that is the only way to sort the issue it will be done as there seems to be no other option.

05/03/2024,Stage 1 Complaint,"Lady has called in on behalf of their daughter to log a complaint as they say their daughter who has learning disabilities cannot advocate for themselves. For the past 2 years they've had constant problems with the boiler and  has been left with no heating / hot water numerous times for at least 3 days at a time. When previously they've enquired about the issues with the boiler they've been told they'll just keep repairing it whilst the parts are available, which Hazel said it isn't good enough. Lady mentioned that since January of this year there has been two occasions (02/01/2024 and 15/01/2024) where tenant has been left without heating / hot water and it is minus temperatures. Then just last week (23/02/2024 - 29/02/2024) it was 6 days before she had working heating / hot water again and was left unable to shower this whole time. Lady has said she offered for Daughter to come to hers during all these times but ultimately this doesn't solve the issue with boiler breaking down so often and something needs to be done.

Tenant has sent some screen shots of top ups but it does not show that is tenants account.

Tenant also not happy that White knight did not attend again this week to complete repair/damp works.  Tenant said she was told by surveyor two weeks ago that the appointment was booked and was told to disconnect her appliances.  Tenant paid somebody to disconnect her appliances and took 3 days off work and said she received less that 24 hours notice that White Knight were not attending.  Tenant wants compensating for the annual leave she has wasted.

Tenant said she received a text from surveyor advising that White knights are attending Monday.  Tenant said she text back advising that she cannot afford to pay for somebody to remove her appliances again and said she received a response saying she will be charged for the missed appointment.  Tenant said she is not happy with this response as it is not her fault that the previous appointment was cancelled.

Dear 

It is my hope that your Christmas and New Year break has gone well and I send you good wishes for 2024.  However, I am sorry to begin with a complaint which is important for all tenants with North Star.  Please pass it on to whichever member of staff at Thornaby deals with this kind of incident.

On Wednesday Dec. 27th I woke to discover my living room was icy cold and found that the radiator was not working.  Other radiators in bathroom,  kitchen and bedrooms were in good order.  At about 8.30 I dialled the 03000....emergency number and held on for 20 minutes receiving only the automated recorded message.  At 9.00 a.m. I tried that number again and held on for 45 minutes with the same result.  At 10.00a.m. I called officer who answered immediately, explained my problem with the radiator and told her about the problem with the emergency number.  Officer was expeditious in arranging for a heating engineer to come. He arrived mid afternoon and resolved the problem.

It is the failure of the dedicated emergency number that troubles me especially as on some days there was no member of staff on duty to help like officer did.  How many calls were made to that number over the festive season.  How much have wasted phone calls cost, in my case over an hour's worth? Google tells me that such numbers cost between 3 and 65 pence per minute. Can I be informed what my calls of 65 minutes cost, and I finish with a suggestion that emergency response numbers should be free calls.

13/11/2023,Stage 1 Complaint,"Tenant has emailed to advise would like to put in complaint about Ian Williams - email received fromr 11/11/23 1224pm - 
Thank you for your email of the 2nd November.
Unfortunately, I haven't heard from anyone. No-one has left any messages from Evenil.
I wish to make a formal complaint about the lack of response from Ian Williams. 
If I don't hear from Evenil shortly I will do so about them as well.
I might suggest that North Star take a good look at these contractors as their attitude might prove costly to North Star either now or in the future.

If you would attend to matters for me I should be most obliged.


Further Notes (NB) : Checked Openhousing There have been four reports from tenant for leaking roof: First report 11/4/23 T0417474
Second report 31/7/23 T0426984 and had gutters cleared according to job details
Third report 26/10/23 T0435274 to recall the previous job? But diary note states contractor cleared gutters last job and found no further issues so would need new job not a recall.
Fourth report 2/11/23 T0435857 for roof inspection but  cancelled as a duplicate as job now raised on Block X address on 7/11/23 for further work above bays. Comp due 5/12/23.

13/11/2023,Stage 1 Complaint,"T has called our Out of Hours on Saturday morning no heat or hot water , was advised to wait 24 hours, she had previously reported this 2 weeks ago, to which she had been told that they would not be attending (something to do with the distance to get there, and refused to come out to do the job, think Property services Manager got involved)

T said that she rang again on Saturday to check they were coming after the last time, then again on Sunday as no one had yet to come out and it was either just before the 24 hours would be up or after, and was told to wait 24 hours, Isnt our out of hours within 4 hours when reported out of office hours?

I am now calling 0800 to see what is happening with this T repair as they have still not been, T said she had told them that she has Reynauds disease and it was freezing, also has had to go out and buy herself a hter.

Orbis also told T that they did not have a phone number for 0800 and that they could email them only. She has had no heating since Saturday morning

Outcome of complaint: Tenant couldn’t think of anything specific, just said that 0800 never seem to want to come out.
Just be mindful to come out when you know there's been asked Cos I've been told they're obligated to come out when you've got no hot water and heating.
They just seem to never come out when I need like when it comes to me having no hot war and heating like I've just think 0 800 repair the services not Very good. And I've had to get a heater.

I have rung 0800 and they have advised that I needed to raise the callout from the weekend to attend, I asked if they would attend today  and that they only have so many engineers that cover that location and they will have to check to see who they can get.

I have had to tell T I will speak to the Property Services Manager and call her back, T said that she has only got today for them to repair as works x 4 12 hours shifts from tomorrow and the next date available would be Saturday.

"16, Oct 2023",Post repair transactional,"which repair are you talking about? either way, the toilet is now leaking in another place so once again the contractor has made the problem worse. electrician turned up to replace a loose socket but, i don't have a loose socket. instead of repairing the website northstars choice to *micromanage repairs through incompetent and rude customer service staff has once again wasted everyones time and money. 
when i was returning home from an appointment, i discovered dum and dummer poking/tampering with my house number? 
they had turned up with no appointment* had no id with them and after claiming to be from northstar dum and dummer  walked around the outside of the bungalow with their hands on their pockets and claimed there was definitely no leak! 
according to northstar if there is extensive mould on the walls but its behind the wallpaper it's not a problem! shame nobody has told the mould spores! telling blatant lies. / i doubt it. these are the same ongoing problems you've done nothing about for years.",ORCH010140002,Post repair comment,General Needs,Gainford,46-55,White: English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British,Bungalow,Disability

Logged a complaint with Ian Williams yesterday and awaiting a call from a manager-was told within 24 hours I would receive a call back, so far-nothing! 
Tried calling North Star whilst at work today but was on hold for too long then had to go back, have photo evidence of everything. Really not happy, caused damage and the ceiling actually looks work than before he came. Wish he'd never touched it now, will cost me more time money and effort in trying to resolve the painting issue.
